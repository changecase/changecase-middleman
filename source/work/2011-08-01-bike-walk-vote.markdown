As the Creative Director at [Bike Walk Vote](http://bikewalkvote.org), a political 
organization supporting active transportation, I created and lead the development
of several assets and campaigns. Among these were the logo, branding, and website
development.

## Logo

The logo for Bike Walk Vote was designed to be recognizable and easily reproduced
on photocopies. The logo references Portland [bike boxes][bikebox].

## Bike Walk Talk Header Images

While recruiting for outreach campaigns (Bike Walk Talk), these banners were 
used on social media headers like Facebook and Google+.

We also ran social media header images on our campaign to elect Jefferson Smith
as Portland Mayor.

## Mayoral Candidate Debate

For the mayoral candidate debate held at Portland State University, Bike Walk 
Vote distributed scorecards to help the attendees determine how the candidates
performed.
