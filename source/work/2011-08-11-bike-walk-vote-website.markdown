I designed and developed the website for [Bike Walk Vote](http://bikewalkvote.org).

While we were building the website, we wanted to be able to take in contact information.

The website itself was built on top of Frank using Haml and LESS. It made use
of responsive design techniques so that the site would be mobile friendly.
