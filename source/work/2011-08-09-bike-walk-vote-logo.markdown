As the Creative Director at [Bike Walk Vote](http://bikewalkvote.org), a political 
organization supporting active transportation, I created and lead the development
of several assets and campaigns. Among these were the logo, branding, and website
development.

The logo for Bike Walk Vote was designed to be recognizable and easily reproduced
on photocopies. The logo references Portland [bike boxes][bikebox].

The logo was used on t-shirts, flyers, brochures, posters, buttons, and
stickers. The logo also served as a starting point for related materials in
campaigns and banners.
