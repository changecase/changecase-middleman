achieve this is through several rounds of sketched iterations before deciding
on a subset to build a high fidelity comp of.

In the end, the result is something like this:

<%= partial(:sharepoint_tile, 
            locals:{ tile: { image_url: 'services.png', 
                             content: { heading: "Professional", 
                                        description: "A bowtie and darby"} } }) %>

<%= partial(:sharepoint_tile, 
            locals:{ tile: { image_url: 'digital.png', 
                             content: { heading: "QR Code", 
                                        description: "A hyperlink you can capture with a camera"} } }) %>

<%= partial(:sharepoint_tile, 
            locals:{ tile: { image_url: 'cd.png', 
                             content: { heading: "CDs",
                                        description: "Store music, documents, and other data"} } }) %>
