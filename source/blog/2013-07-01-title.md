I've been using [Frank](https://github.com/blahed/frank "Frank, the Static Site Non-Framework") to generate the static pages of a few sites I'm working on. This has been great, especially for data that is generated, but doesn't change all that much.

It has led to cleaner files and faster load times. I've been seperating the various views into layouts, cleaning up the construction of the html with [haml](http://haml.info/ "The HAML markup language"), automating tasks with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ "Ruby programming language"), and composing copy in [maruku](https://github.com/bhollis/maruku "Maruku mantained by Ben Hollis").

I ran into a problem the other day though.

## The Problem

We use Citrix's GoToMeeting, GoToTraining, and GoToWebinar for a few activities at Advisicon. We expose our schedule of upcoming webinars and online training sessions with the GoToTraining API and the GoToWebinar API. I'm using the [GoToTraining Ruby API wrapper](https://github.com/citrixonline/GoToTraining-Ruby) and the [GoToWebinar Ruby API wrapper](https://github.com/citrixonline/GoToWebinar-Ruby) to produce the upcoming calendars.

This has been working great, but I realized that the code between the two is pretty similar. I could remove the redundancy by moving the Ruby out of the page and into its own method that encapsulates both GoToTraining and GoToWebinar. This would also enable me to use a single maruku filter in haml, improving the readability and utility of markdown.

First, I need to successfully move at least one of them out of the calling page.
