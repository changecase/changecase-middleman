Many teams make the mistake of focusing on how they build things or what
they're building. This leads to backlogs full of to do lists masquarading as
user stories ("As a product manager I want a list of items so that I can see my
items") and gantt charts beautifully doomed to crumble at the first dependency
on intellectual work. 

I ask a lot of questions when I'm brought in to help teams. This helps us all
to take a step back and articulate the problem we're solving. It also ensures
that we're all trying to solve the same problem.

Those questions tend to be variations on the following:

* Who do you think is going to use this?
* What are they trying to do?
* What's in it for us?
* What do we think the solution is?

Often, teams (especially their leadership) have canned answers to all of those
questions, but they lack any real information. Here's what I'm actually getting
at.

# Who do you think is going to use this?

I mean specifically. These are the people who's behavior we're looking to
change. You probably know that building something for "everyone" is a great way
to build something that doesn't work for anyone. You might think the answer is
"Admins" or "HR Managers." You're probably wrong.

HR Managers may be one aspect of what makes these folks similar, but we're
really only interested in a subset to start. If we're successful with those
folks, we can start talking about broadening scope. Let's get to the first
release first though.

So, what are the attributes of these people that will help us predict that they
demonstrate the behavior we're looking to impact (see the next question)? We
don't need a trawling net of demographic data, just the important relevant
bits.

# What are they trying to do?

I'm not asking about your product/feature. At this point, I don't care how your
thing works or what it does. I want to know what these folks are trying to do
in their life/job that is relevant to the thing you're proposing.

Maybe the person you're building this for needs some produce at their house so
that they can make dinner. The don't want to use your widget (Prime Now, Uber
Eats, your favorite food delivery service) in order to use your widget; they
have a greater goal in mind. What is that?

This is ultimately the behavior we're looking to impact with our offering. It
is probably worth covering how these folks do it now.

# What's in it for us?

We are a business. It would probably be a good idea for us to try to stay in
business.

If we know who we want to solve a problem for and we know what their problem
is, the next thing to do is figure out if it makes sense for _our business_ to
solve that problem.

It might be tempting to respond with a general corporate initiative (e.g.,
"more money", "more customers", "fewer bugs", "fewer support calls", etc.).
That's not wrong, but it isn't specific enough to help direct our work and get
answers to what we really need to know.

What we come up with here generally has some numbers attached. That helps us to
align on the effect size we expect to have on whatever we're impacting. Maybe
we need to decrease the rate of reports filed to the wrong customer by 10%. It
also helps us think through the time it will take see this effect once we
release. We might expect that it will take two months before we start seeing
the fruits of our labor once we've deployed a solution.

In the end, this is our measure of success.

# What do we think the solution is?

Okay, you've stuck with me this far. What's your idea? What is your proposal
for solving this thing for this person while also benefiting NAVEX in this way?

Awesome. That sounds great.

Now let's scale it back. What's the smallest thing that we need to build before
we can tell that we're building the wrong thing? How will we know that we're
right or wrong?

Cool. Let's focus on that for now.
