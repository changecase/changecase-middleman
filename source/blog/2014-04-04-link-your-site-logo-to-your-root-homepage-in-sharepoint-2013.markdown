On most websites, clicking on the site logo will take you back to the website
homepage. Given this established interaction pattern, Microsoft has made an 
extremely odd choice in SharePoint: instead of bringing you to the homepage, 
clicking on the site logo takes you to the root page of the current site 
collection.

Here's how to fix Microsoft's mistake in SharePoint 2013.

## Locate the Master Page

You'll need to edit the Master Page in order to make this change (and the relevant
permissions to access it). If you find you don't have access, talk to your 
site administrator.

To get to your Master Pages via the SharePoint ribbon, click the **Settings** gear,
and select **Site settings** from the dropdown menu. You'll find yourself at 
the _Site Settings_ page.

If you have the permissions you need you'll see a **Web Designer Galleries** 
section. Click on **Master pages and page layouts** to access all of your Master
Pages. 

If you'd prefer to navigate directly to your Master Page Gallery, you can enter 
the following URI in your browser's address bar (replace `changecase.net` with 
your SharePoint install's root address):

~~~
http://changecase.net/_catalogs/masterpage/Forms/AllItems.aspx
~~~

Download the HTML Master Page that you've applied to your SharePoint site and 
open it up in your favorite text editor (A short list of my favorite text 
editors include vim, Sublime Text 2, and Notpad++... Yeah, I'm not a gmacs guy). 
If you work in SharePoint Designer or Visual Studio, I'll assume you know how 
to navigate to your Master Page already.

In this example we'll use the master page from the default SharePoint 2013 theme, 
Oslo: `oslo.html`. There are two things to note here:

### 1. Edit the HTML Master Page

There are very likely three files with similar names in the Master Page Gallery, 
`oslo.html`, `oslo.master`, and `oslo.preview`. You want `oslo.html`.

The file `oslo.master` will be regenerated by SharePoint when you upload your 
changes.

The file `oslo.preview` is related to theming. It is a file neccessary for 
selecting your from the theme preview. It is of no concern to us here.

### 2. Don't Make Changes to Default Files

Since we are going to be working on making changes to one of the default 
Master Pages, we risk breaking things terribly. Instead of making your changes 
in `oslo.html`, save your changes with a new filename. This way, you can always
revert back to `oslo.html` if neccessary.

This is a rule to hold to when working on anything with SharePoint. If you are 
making changes built off a default file, call your changed file something different.
Sure, you may have to go back and re-connect a few links when you do this, but 
that's better than bringing your whole site down when you update.

We'll call our new Master Page `copenhagen.html`. When we upload our changes, 
SharePoint will generate `copenhagen.master`.

## Edit the Master Page

Locate the SiteLogoImage control. It will look something like this:

~~~ html
<!--<MS:<SharePoint:SPSimpleSiteLink CssClass="ms-siteicon-a" runat="server" id="onetidProjectPropertyTitleGraphic">-->
  <!--<MS:<SharePoint:SiteLogoImage CssClass="ms-siteicon-img" name="onetidHeadbnnr0" id="ontidHeadbnnr2" LogoImageURL="/_layouts/15/images/siteIcon.png?rev=23" runat="server">-->
    <!--PS: Start of READ-ONLY PREVIEW (do not modify)--><img id="ct100_onetidHeadbnnr2" class="ms-siteicon-img" name="onetidHeadbnnr0" Src="http://changecase.net/_layouts/15/images/siteIcon.png?rev=23" alt="Content site" /><!--PE: End of READ-ONLY PREVIEW-->
  <!--ME:</SharePoint:SPLinkButton>-->
<!--ME:</SharePoint:SPSimpleSiteLink>-->
~~~

Now, all you need to do is replace the `SPSimpleSiteLink` with something better.
[According to MSDN][1], this control is pretty useless. It merely "provides a link 
to the current site." In other words, it does irrational shit.

So, to fix it, you need to replace the SPSimpleSiteLink control with something 
more useful. In this case, it is pretty easy: just replace it with the `SPLinkButton` 
control:

~~~ html
<!--MS:<SharePoint:SPLinkButton runat="server" NavigateUrl="~sitecollection/" id="onetidProjectPropertyTitleGraphic">-->
  <!--MS:<SharePoint:SiteLogoImage name="onetidHeadbnnr0" id="onetidHeadbnnr2" LogoImageUrl="images/logo.png" runat="server">-->
    <!--PS: Start of READ-ONLY PREVIEW (do not modify)--><img id="ct100_onetidHeadbnnr2" class="ms-siteicon-img" name="onetidHeadbnnr0" Src="http://changecase.net/_layouts/15/images/siteIcon.png?rev=23" alt="Content site" /><!--PE: End of READ-ONLY PREVIEW-->
  <!--ME:</SharePoint:SiteLogoImage>-->
<!--ME:</SharePoint:SPLinkButton<-->
~~~

## Commit to Your Changes

Now, upload (or save) `copenhagen.html` back into the Master Page Gallery. 
When uploading the file, make sure to mark the file's **Type** as _HTML Master
Page_ and mark the checkbox for compatability with **15**. SharePoint will 
generate `copenhagen.master` for you.

If versioning has been turned on in your environment (and it should be!),  you'll 
have to **Publish a Major Version** of `copenhagen.html` in order to apply your
changes. After doing so, you'll be able to select the master page from the Design 
Manager.
