Creating your own custom tiles is super easy in SharePoint 2013. Organizing 
them can take a little bit more planning. 

The following method will create tiles that will work from theme to theme 
without needing any further configuration. It will also ensure that you are 
using a sensible pattern for storing your assets. And, when you were done, it 
will look like Microsoft made your icon!

## Create the Tile Image

Let's start with some assumptions:

- You've already figured out where you are going to link from and where you 
  are linking to. The tiles are glorified hyperlinks, so you need a source 
  (to display the tiles) and a destination (to send the user to).
- The theme you are using uses a color for the `TileBackgroundOverlay` slot in
  its `.spcolor` file. For more on SharePoint's color palette file, see the 
  MSDN article [Color palettes and fonts in SharePoint 2013][1]. If you are 
  using a very light color in this slot, you'll want to build your tile as a
  dark color.
- You have the necessary SharePoint permissions to add apps and edit lists. One 
  of the apps you have permission to add is **Promoted Links**.
- You have access to image editing software that can create [24-bit PNG][2] files.

With those items squared away, create your png. It should be 150px square and 
use a transparent background. The transparency will allow the color set in 
your theme's `TileBackgroundOverlay` slot to show through. Use white (hex color 
`#FFFFFF`) as your non-transparent pixels.

### Change the Background Color ###

By using transparent pixels in a 24-bit PNG, the tile will work on just about 
any color background. Be careful of the very light hues though.

<%= partial(:sharepoint_tile, locals: { 
  tile: { 
    image_url: 'changecase-suitcase.min.png'
  },
  form: {
    name: "tileBackgroundColor",
    background_color: {
      color: "#aaaaaa",
      label: "Background color"
    }
  }
}) %>

</aside>

It is helpful to work in a vector image editing program for this, like Adobe
Illustrator. Do your work in any other color and then turn all of your shapes 
white before exporting to png.

When you export your png, make sure to save it as a 24-bit png file (aka, png-24).
This will result in a slightly larger file size, but a much more crisp result.

## Upload to SharePoint

With your new, shiny image in hand, it is time to upload it to SharePoint. 
Upload your image to the **Site Assets** folder of your destination site.

This pattern will be useful when you find that you want to link to this site 
from multiple locations. 

For example, the ACME company is going to link to a site for their sales 
department site. They also want to use that tile on their root homepage, on the 
accounting department's site, and on the PMO's site.

You'll know that the resources you need are always going to be located in the 
same guessable location: 

~~~url
[YOUR SHAREPOINT URI]/[PATH TO THE LINK DESTINATION SITE]/SiteAssets/[FILENAME].png
~~~

ACME's sales department logo would be at: 

~~~url
http://sharepoint.example.com/ACME/Sales/SiteAssets/sales-icon.png
~~~

## Create a Promoted List

Navigate to the site you will be linking from and access **Site Contents**. 
Since ACME is going to be linking to the sales subsite from three different 
locations (the accounting subsite, the PMO subsite, and the root homepage), 
they'll have to access Site Contents on each subsite.

~~~url
http://sharepoint.example.com/ACME/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/_layouts/15/viewlsts.aspx
http://sharepoint.example.com/ACME/Accounts/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/_layouts/15/viewlsts.aspx
http://sharepoint.example.com/ACME/PMO/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/_layouts/15/viewlsts.aspx
~~~

In each Site Contents, select **add an app** and choose **Promoted Links**. 
Give your list of tiles an appropriate name. ACME might name it "Departments" 
on the root homepage, "Pipelines" on the accounting subsite, and "Portfolios" 
on the PMO subsite.

## Populate the Promoted Links List

Navigate to the promoted links list and start adding some links. ACME would be 
doing this from the following locations:

~~~url
http://sharepoint.example.com/ACME/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Lists/Departments/allitems.aspx
http://sharepoint.example.com/ACME/PMO/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Lists/Pipelines/allitems.aspx
http://sharepoint.example.com/ACME/PMO/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Lists/Portfolios/allitems.aspx
~~~

Give each new item a **Title**. This will be the text that shows up on the tile
when a mouse is _not_ hovering over it. ACME would enter "Sales" here.

For the **Background Image Location**, use the URI of the tile image you uploaded
earlier. Add a description of the image to aid screen readers and other 
assistive devices.

Any text you enter in the **Description** will be displayed when a mouse overs 
over the tile. Use this to provide a little bit of information about the 
destination of the link.

Add the destination URI in the **Link Location**. Give this a description as well.

You can change the way the link will be followed by changing the **Launch Behavior**.
The **In page navigation** setting is best for most uses and conforms to user 
expectations about navigation on the web.

The **Order** provides a weighting to the tile to determine its order in the 
list of tiles.

Hit the **Save** button to add the tile to the list.

### Preview the Populated Fields ###

Test the title and description!

<%= partial(:sharepoint_tile, locals: {
  tile: {
    image_url: 'changecase-suitcase.min.png',
    content: true
  },
  form: {
    name: 'fieldPreview',
  }
}) %>

</aside>

## Display the Tiles on a Site Page

Now that you've got a list that contains one (or several) tiles, you need to 
display the list in a Web Part on a Site Page. 

Navigate to the Site Page that the tiles should appear on and go to **Edit page**
in the **Settings** cog.

On the **Insert** tab **Parts** group, select **Web Part**.

Select **Apps** in the **Categories**. In **Parts**, select the title of the 
Promoted Links List you created.

Click the **Add** button to add and display the Promoted Links List.

Save your changes: go to the **Format Text** tab **Edit** group and select 
**Save**.

## Add More Tiles

To add more tiles, just create and upload a new 24-bit PNG file for the tile 
image (using our established pattern) and add a new item to the Promoted 
Links List!
