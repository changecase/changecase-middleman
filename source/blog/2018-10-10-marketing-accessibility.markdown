When talking to companies about baking accessibility into their products from
the beginning, we'll often spend a lot of attention on the ethical and legal
considerations. This is rarely enough for marketing teams and sales teams who
are looking to answer questions like, "How can I sell this?" or "How can I use
this to attact attention?"

Some will make the mistake of treating accessibility as an add-on package --
additional functionality for a fee.

There are other reasons to build accessible products beyond adhering to ethical
standards or reducing the risk of litigation. Here are two.

# Accessible design helps everybody, drives innovation

Often when we're talking about accessibility, the people we're speaking with
have an archetypal image in their mind of someone severely disabled: blind
people, deaf people, people in wheelchairs, people with cognitive impairments.

Sometimes we'll remember to point out that as people get older (like their 20s
and 30s) their cognitive abilities will begin to decline, especially around
[visual short term memory tasks][1]. A user's ability to understand, interpret,
and retain information can also be impacted by factors like the way they learn,
how distracted they are, and their emotional state (because
"My-boss-told-me-this-morning-I-need-to-deliver-five-projects-by-the-end-of-the-week-that-are-all-behind-schedule-and-my-sister-is-getting-married-this-weekend-and-I-skipped-lunch-today").

But age, fatigue, or just holding something else in your hand can make your
movements less precise. A more forgiving system that uses techniques like
larger hit areas for clickable things and alternate input modalities like
keyboard, touch, and voice can be helpful here. Plus, they are great for power
users and demos.

Making a product easier to use by the visually impaired can evoke the robotic
sound of screen readers parsing a page or the rage of a color-blind executive
struggling with input validation on a form. Techniques like larger text are
also great for people who aren't right next to their monitor, and high color
contrast ratios help people with sunlight shining on their screen.

The better a screen reader can understand a page, the better other computerized
systems can parse and use the data to improve the experience (like recognizing
phone numbers and dialing them at a tap). On consumer-facing sites, this tends
to improve SEO. 

But people without visual impairments use screen reading technology as well â€“
to have the content read to them while they are engaged in another task. And
screen readers are easy to get, free versions are available for browsers and
come installed in modern operating systems like Windows and macOS.

# Building accessible products makes you awesome

Companies like [Microsoft][2] and [Google][3] recognize that paying attention to
accessibility is a brand differentiator. It shows stewardship and leadership in
building a better world.

When you focus on accessibility, you end up making things easier on yourself as
you introduce mobile experiences, voice experiences, and the innovative
experiences of tomorrow. It helps to provide the initial steps in making
multiple products work together. As we continue to push into new paradigms, new
ways to communicate with our users, accessible design will continue to be a
very useful technique.
